# Decentralized Voting System

## Overview

The Decentralized Voting System is a smart contract project built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to create proposals and vote on them in a transparent and tamper-proof manner. Each proposal has a description and a voting period, during which users can cast their votes. Once the voting period ends, the contract tallies the votes and determines the outcome.

## Features

- **Proposal Creation:** Users can create proposals with a description and specify a voting period.
- **Voting:** Users can cast their votes (yes or no) on active proposals during the voting period.
- **Vote Tallying:** After the voting period ends, the contract automatically tallies the votes and announces the result.
- **Transparency:** All proposals, votes, and results are stored on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
